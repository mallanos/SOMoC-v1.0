ðŸ“Œ **SOMoC**

SOMoC is a clustering methodology for small molecules. It is based on the combination of molecular fingerprinting, dimensionality reduction by the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) algorithm, and clustering with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithm.

Further details of the algorithm can be found in the original publication:
iRaPCA and SOMoC: Development and Validation of Web Applications for New Approaches for the Clustering of Small Molecules. Denis N. Prada Gori, Manuel A. Llanos, Carolina L. Bellera, Alan Talevi, and Lucas N. Alberca. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling. DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00265

This is a fork which aims to improve the original algorithm (only the standalone version) by introducing several new features and functionality improvements.
As the code is being heavily refactored it may not work as expected. Also, documentation is on the way !
